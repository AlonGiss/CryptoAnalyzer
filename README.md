# CryptoAnalyzer
Python tool for automatic detection and decoding of common encodings anCipherScope is a Python-based cryptanalysis tool that automatically detects and decodes common classical encodings and ciphers.

It supports automatic identification and brute-force decoding of:
- Hexadecimal
- Base64
- Binary
- Caesar cipher
- XOR (single-byte)

The project uses heuristic analysis, character frequency scoring, and confidence estimation to determine the most likely encryption type and decoding result.

Designed as a learning and practical tool for cryptography, CTF challenges, and security fundamentals.
d classical ciphers using heuristic analysis and brute-force techniques.
